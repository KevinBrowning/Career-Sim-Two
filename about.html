      <h2>Get to know me</h2>
      <p>My name is Kevin Browning, and I am from a small town in Michigan called Garden City. Born in Detroit and
        living in Garden City most of my life I have recently
        moved to the city of Westland where I know live. I am and alumnus of Michigan State University where I majored
        in media and info tech. I come from a relitively small
        family although we are very close! I decided in September of 2023 that I was going to change careers as what I
        was doing before (Adminstration Leader for a dental
        company) was not my calling! I quit my job on January 31st 2024 to prepare for this exciting journey and switch
        into this line of work! I am having an amazing
        experience so far learning all about coding and am so excited to see where this will take me!

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I am a very active person! Some of my favorite hobbies include Golfing, Bowling, and Exercising! I recently
        developed a love for the game of golf about
        3 years ago when a couple of my buddies convinced me to try it, I immediately was hooked! I am in a bowling
        league that bowls every other weekend and
        currently have a 183 average that I'm always trying to improve! Exercising has always been an off and on
        interest of mine, mainly when I was younger
        and playing a lot of sports. However, this year I have been more proactive in taking care of myself and have
        been working hard to get into better shape!
        I also love spending time with my friends, family, and my girlfriend Samiha. I am also a huge sports fan! I love
        talking about any and all things
        related to sports, especially football!
